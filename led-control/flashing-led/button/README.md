# Button

A somewhat oversimplified name, but this program allows you to trigger the
flashing of the LED via hardware buttons on the breadboard. It also allows
you to adjust the speed of the flashing via a second button, and visualizes
that speed across three other GPIO outputs to single-color LEDs.
